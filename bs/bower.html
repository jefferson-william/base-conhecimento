Comments are not allowed in the bower.json file (See http://blog.getify.com/json-comments/ for why this is silly), so 
they are added here.

The bower.json file is responsible for the installing the styles (CSS, LESS, etc.) and scripts (JavaScript, TypeScript 
etc.) using <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>. See the official 
<a href="https://github.com/bower/bower.json-spec">bower.json specification</a> for more information.

<ul>
    <li>
        name - This is used if you want to create your own Bower package. Unfortunately, this is required by Bower. It
        does not matter what goes here too much.
    </li>
    <li>
        private - This is not a public bower repository This is a way to prevent accidental publication of private
        repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
        dependencies - The client side styles and scripts your application depends on. These are downloaded to a
        bower_components folder at the root of the project.
